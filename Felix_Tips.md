- No global variables
- No format changes in files where no behavior was changed
- Use existing directory for export (according to security policies in file_paths.xml)
- Make it crash-safe with try/catch-clauses (file-I/O code can crash everywhere)
- Save file async to improve performance (Cororoutines)
- Code cleanups
